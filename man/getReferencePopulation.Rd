This function returns the age group and gender stratified demographic distribution
for various geographic regions. It provides the proportion of the population
in each age group, broken down by gender, for the selected region. The current
implementation includes data for the US, UK, Canada, Europe, Japan, China, and
a worldwide population.
}
\details{
The proportions are approximations based on available demographic data for the
selected region. For more accurate and updated data, refer to official statistics
agencies such as the US Census Bureau, Eurostat, Statistics Canada, Japan's
Statistics Bureau, and China's National Bureau of Statistics.
